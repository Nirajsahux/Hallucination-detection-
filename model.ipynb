less than 2 vlinear voltage tracking regulators are highprecision voltage regulators designed to supply offboard loads for electronics such as sensors microphones satellite ecus and small lamps these types of linear regulators do not have their own internal voltage reference so they must accurately track an externally provided voltage reference this external voltage enables precise data acquisition from the sensor typical automotive applications for linear voltage tracking regulators include powertrains body and comfort functions and chassis and transmissioninfineon offers a selection of variable linear voltage regulators ldo also called adjustable voltage regulators which are suitable for industrial applications this type of linear voltage regulator converts an input voltage within a specific range to an output voltage required by the load the output voltage is adjustable which makes low dropout adjustable voltage regulators a highly flexible option for system designersthe quiescent current is another import characteristic of linear voltage regulators ldo a linear voltage regulator requires a low quiescent current to operate its internal circuit when the system is in standby mode in this idle state there is little to no output load required however the ldo will continue to draw a quiescent current for preparation of a load quiescent current will generally dissipate in the form of heat while the system remains idle\\twhat is the primary feature of the 1edn71x6gu gate driver family\\tthe output voltage being adjustable in low dropout adjustable

which a linear regulator will function unlike standard linear voltage regulators low dropout regulators can function with a dropout voltage of less than 2 vlinear voltage tracking regulators are highprecision voltage regulators designed to supply offboard loads for electronics such as sensors microphones satellite ecus and small lamps these types of linear regulators do not have their own internal voltage reference so they must accurately track an externally provided voltage reference this external voltage enables precise data acquisition from the sensor typical automotive applications for linear voltage tracking regulators include powertrains body and comfort functions and chassis and transmissioninfineon offers a selection of variable linear voltage regulators ldo also called adjustable voltage regulators which are suitable for industrial applications this type of linear voltage regulator converts an input voltage within a specific range to an output voltage required by the load the output voltage is adjustable which makes low dropout adjustable voltage regulators a highly flexible option for system designersthe quiescent current is another import characteristic of linear voltage regulators ldo a linear voltage regulator requires a low quiescent current to operate its internal circuit when the system is in standby mode in this idle state there is little to no output load required however the ldo will continue to draw a quiescent current for preparation of a load quiescent current will generally dissipate in the form of heat while the system remains idle\\twhat is a variable linear voltage regulator\\ta variable linear voltage regulator is a type of linear voltage regulator that has a fixed output voltage\\t1\\t\\nnearfield communication nfc is a
